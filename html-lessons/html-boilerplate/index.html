        <h1>Hello World!</h1>

        <p>When the browser encounters new lines like this in your HTML, it will compress them down into one single space. The result of this compression is that all of the text is clumped together into one long line.</p>

        <p>If we want to create paragraphs in HTML, we need to use the paragraph element, which will add a new line after each of our paragraphs. A paragraph element is defined by wrapping text content with a < p > tag.</p>

        <h2>The strong element</h2>

        <p>The < strong > element makes text <strong>bold</strong>. It also semantically marks text as important; this affects tools, like screen readers, that users with visual impairments will rely on to use your website. The tone of voice on some screen readers will change to communicate the importance of the text within a strong element. To define a strong element we wrap text content in a <strong> tag.</p>

        <h2>The Em element</h2>

        <p>The < em > element makes text <em>italic.</em> It also semantically places emphasis on the text, which again may affect things like screen readers. To define an emphasised element we wrap text content in a < em > tag.</p>

        <h2>HTML Comments</h2>

        <p>HTML comments are not visible to the browser; they allow us to comment on our code so that other developers or our future selves can read them and get some context about something that might not be clear in the code.

        <p>Writing an HTML comment is simple: We just enclose the comment with --> and <! --tags.</p>
        <!-- Salutari! -->
